Unplanned hospital visits create a significant financial and public-health burden. Emergency Room (ER) visits alone cost the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars annually, and nearly half of the U.S. adults report delaying care due to cost barriers. This creates a reinforcing cycle wherein patients who cannot afford preventative or timely care experience health deterioration that eventually results in expensive, unavoidable ER visits. Hospital readmissions, defined as return visits shortly after discharge, are widely used as a proxy for poor care quality and deteriorating health. Early identification of these high-risk patients can enable targeted interventions. 

Our project’s goal is to build predictive models that predict and flag patients at high risk of readmission. A well-performing classification model would allow hospitals and insurance to allocate limited care coordination resources more efficiently and prevent avoidable hospitalizations. They could reduce the operational and financial strain on ER departments and improve patients’ quality of life, particularly for vulnerable or high-risk populations.
